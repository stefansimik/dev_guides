    "    * No. The project's `.env` folder is lightweight and uses symlinks to reference the base Python installation. It only contains:\n",
    "        - Project-specific packages\n",
    "        - Minimal configuration\n",
    "        - Links to the base Python installation\n",
    "* **Can I use Python installed by uv directly from my OS?**\n",
    "    * No. Python versions installed by `uv` are:\n",
    "        - Managed in uv's own directory\n",
    "        - Only accessible through `uv` commands\n",
    "        - Not available as system-wide Python installations\n",
